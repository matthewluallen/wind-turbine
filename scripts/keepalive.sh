# Connection-gated keep-alive for CS460 Module 4 Codespaces.
# Prints to this terminal (which resets the Codespace idle timer) ONLY while a lab
# network-service port has an active browser connection (Node-RED HMI 1880,
# Grafana 3000, noVNC Wireshark 8080, Caldera 8888). After the tabs disconnect it
# waits a short grace window, then stops, so the Codespace idle-times-out normally.
# A hard cap bounds total keep-alive time in case a tab is left open and abandoned.
#
# Tunable via Codespaces variables:
#   KEEPALIVE_PORTS      space-separated ports to watch (default: 1880 3000 8080 8888)
#   KEEPALIVE_GRACE_MIN  minutes to stay awake after last connection (default: 5)
#   KEEPALIVE_CAP_MIN    hard cap on total keep-alive minutes       (default: 120)
